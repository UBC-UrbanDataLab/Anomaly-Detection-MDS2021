# Team Contract

## Goals

- Complete a project that includes working with streaming data, completing data analysis and providing the output as a dashboard product.
- Complete the project to UDL and Data 599 requirements.
- Providing a high quality project but not going overboard - scoping the project appropriate upfront.
- Have the project go smoothly.
- Completing the anomaly detection with machine learning (not just rule based).
- Learning different technologies (Azure, etc).

## Work Norms

- Varying 'core hours' between team members is ok:
    - Nate: ~8 am - 5 pm
    - Ryan: ~8 am - 5 pm with a break or two + bit in evening
    - Mitch: ~10am to late
- Minimize work on weekends (hopefully only an hr or two).
- Aim to keep project at a consistent ~40 hrs/week (avoid large amounts of time later in the project).
- Daily stand-ups at 10 am (blockers etc).
- Sprint planning - working on 1 week sprints, details to be determined with UDL shortly.
- With the short-term project, need to ensure we're hitting deadlines and moving onto subsequent tasks.
- Work will be divided based on team discussions, generally trying to split equal loads, and based on interest in tasks.
- Clubhouse used for Kanban.
- If struggling with a task, provide lots of advance communication and the group will help sort it out.
- Work will be reviewed using Pull Requests and discussed/resolved using comments as well as in Slack/Clubhouse.
- Keep PRs smaller but don't overwhelm with needless PRs.
- Lots of communication should be used.
- Follow code-standards.md


## Meeting Norms

- Regular meetings:
    - Daily 10 am stand-up
    - Weekly w/ client at TBD
    - Tuesday am w/ profs time TBD
- Irregular meetings:
    - Try and figure these out with as much advance communication as is possible
- Meeting action items will go into Clubhouse.
- Client and prof meetings require meeting minutes - to be filed under `meeting-minutes` folder (Nate will complete and commit into his weekly log branch).

## Decision Making

- All major project direction decisions will be discussed and decided upon as a group.
- Minor decisions that need to be made for a task can be made (but if in doubt, ask the group) as work will be reviewed as part of a Pull Request.
- Any decision conflicts will be discussed/resolved in a group setting as required.
