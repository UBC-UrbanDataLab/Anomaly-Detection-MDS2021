# Personal Logs

Each team member folder contains an Excel file with daily logs grouped by project week.

## Team Progress

A brief description of tasks completed in each week is provided below. The tables provide the general tasks that were completed and list individual contributions.

**Week 1: Project Definition and Proposal**

The first project week consisted of:

- Select/Define Project
- Create Project Management Tools
- Write Project Proposal
- Background Data Review

All team-members contributed to the above tasks.

**Week 2: Data and Systems Understanding**

Goals for the second project week included:

- Select Project Data and Complete EDA (still in progress at the end of Week 2)
- Understand Data Systems
- Learn InfluxDB and Telegraf
- Simulate Streaming in InfluxDB
- Anomaly Detection Research

Additionally, a Telegraf parser was worked on allowing streaming data directly into InfluxDB.

| Nate | Mitch | Ryan | All |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Learn InfluxDB and Telegraf, Simulate Streaming in InfluxDB, Investigate Streaming Detection Frameworks, Project Management | Anomaly Detection Research | Learn InfluxDB and Telegraf, EDA, XML Parser | Get a Local Setup of InfluxDB and Telegraf Working in Docker, Work on Streaming Data Parser |

**Week 3: Anomaly Detection Model**

Goals for the third project week included:

- Complete EDA from Week 2
- Data Cleaning/Feature Processing
- Build Streaming Framework for Anomaly Detection Model
- Meet with Domain Experts
- Start Reviewing Azure (secondary goal)

Helping implement the Telegraf parser to support getting streaming data into InfluxDB was also worked on.

| Nate | Mitch | Ryan | All |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build Streaming Framework and Test Locally, Project Management | Ongoing Anomaly Detection Research | Ongoing EDA, Help with Anomaly Detection Research, Support Telegraf Parsing | Meet with Domain Experts |

**Notes:** 

- Felt that additional time was required on anomaly detection research before building the model. Accordingly, building the model was moved to Week 4.
- Also, with the ongoing EDA this week data cleaning will was largely moved to Week 4.
- An additional item not included in the schedule was research of good anomaly detection performance measures, this week be completed early next week.
- We will need to self-label anomalies in the dataset.
